      Enjoy both the ocean view with the sunrise and the tidal march with
      the sunset from this home on Glades Road just a minute walk from
      2 beaches. Porches on 3 sides. Outdoor shower. Offstreet parking.
      Huge backyard with access (at high tide) to Cohasset Harbor by
      kayak, paddle board or small inflatable with outboard.
      The street has no parking so day trippers to the beach can not
      park, so it is never crowded. The same families have owned or
      rented here for years.

      Train to Boston is a 10 minute drive away and it takes about 56
      minutes. Scituate Harbor and Cohasset are about a 10 minute
      drive.
